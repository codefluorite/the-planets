            <p className="p-center">A god of war, and yet thou slumber’st still,
                Thy crimson sands lie barren, cold, and dry.
                Did once thy rivers heed their maker’s will?
                Dost echoes of lost voices haunt thy sky?
                Yet mortal hands do reach to claim thy dust,
                And whisper hopes of life upon thy plain.
                Shall thou once more be wakened by their trust?
                Shall life arise and dance upon thee again?
                O Mars, dost thou but wait for time’s embrace,
                To carve anew the rivers on thy face?
            </p>
