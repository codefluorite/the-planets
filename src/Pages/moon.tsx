            <p className="p-center">O silver wanderer of midnight’s shroud,
                Soft sentinel that weeps where none may see.
                Thy gentle light doth part the heavy cloud,
                And guides lost hearts upon the boundless sea.
                Yet, fickle art thou—waxing, waning, pale—
                A fleeting ghost upon the dreaming sky.
                Dost thou lament, behind thy misty veil?
                Or dost thou smile as silent years drift by?
                O lonely queen, dost wait for dawn’s embrace?
                Or dost thou love the night and not its chase?
            </p>
