            <p className="p-center">O sovereign fair, bedecked in rings of light,
                A gilded wonder wrought in heaven’s hand.
                No mortal crown could shine with half thy might,
                Nor kingly jewels with such grace be spanned.
                Thy golden circle, vast beyond compare,
                Doth weave a dance unbroken, soft, and true.
                Yet all who dare to wander near thee there,
                Must fear the icy shards that round thee strew.
                O Saturn, guardian of time’s embrace,
                Forever dost thou spin in silent grace.
            </p>
        </>
