            <p className="p-center">A phantom blue, adrift in endless night,
                Where tempests howl with voices never still.
                No ship may sail thy seas, no beacon bright
                May pierce the shroud that cloaks thy world in chill.
                Yet still dost thou in distant vigil turn,
                Thy mighty winds the fiercest ever known.
                And in thy depths, where unseen shadows churn,
                What nameless things in secret still have grown?
                O Neptune, lord of oceans vast and deep,
                Within thy tides, what ancient whispers sleep?
            </p>
