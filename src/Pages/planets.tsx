            <p>We all have to start from somewhere.</p>
            <p>This website was created in React with the theme of Shakespeare and the planets using Chat GPT.</p>
            <p>The aim of this short project was to create a basic website with the following objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a basic website with pages.</li>
                <li>Utilise react-route-dom to create router pages and use link to create navigation links to them.</li>
                <li>Create a layout with a header, navigation bar, content page, and footer bar.</li>
                <li>Use AI to write a basic sonnet about each planet in the solar in the style of Shakespeare.</li>
            </ul>
        </>
