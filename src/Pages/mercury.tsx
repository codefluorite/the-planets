            <p className="p-center">Swift herald of the mighty god of light,
                Thou dost in fiery haste embrace the sun.
                No rest is thine, nor shade to cloak thy flight,
                Yet still thy fleeting course is never done.
                Like silver phantom, dost thou dance unseen,
                A whisper â€˜fore the morning wakes anew.
                What secrets dost thou hide in lands so lean?
                What wisdom in thy golden furnace grew?
                Though none may tarry long upon thy face,
                Still dost thou race, and time cannot thee chase.
            </p>
        </>
