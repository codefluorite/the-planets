            <p className="p-center">O blazing heart that rules the vault of day,
                Thy golden chariot rides the endless blue.
                With fire thou dost chase the night away,
                And wake the world with dawn's enkindled hue.
                What king could match thy throne of burning light?
                What forge could temper beams so fierce and bright?
                Yet even thou, in time, must dim thy might,
                And fade into the silent womb of night.
                But lo! Though dark shall claim thee at the last,
                Thy embers light the future as the past.
            </p>
