            <p className="p-center">A world of ice where silent tempests brood,
                Strange wanderer cast upon a tilted flight.
                Dost thou defy the gods, in wayward mood?
                Or hath the fates spun thee in jesting spite?
                No fire warms thy realm, no sunbeam stays,
                Yet still thy pallid glow doth haunt the deep.
                And though in frozen dark thou spendâ€™st thy days,
                The moons around thee dare not rest nor sleep.
                O tilted world, dost thou in sorrow roll,
                Or doth thou laugh and mock the cosmic whole?
            </p>
