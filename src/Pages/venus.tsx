            <p className="p-center">O fairest star that graces eventide,
                Thy beauty is a veil of cruel disguise.
                For ‘neath thy golden shroud doth rage abide,
                And fire falls ‘stead of rain from ashen skies.
                The tempests shriek where oceans once did gleam,
                Thy breath a poison none may dare inhale.
                No lover walks upon this scalding dream,
                No hand may touch thee, lest it burn and pale.
                Yet still dost thou, with soft and golden glow,
                Ensnare the hearts of those who gaze below.
            </p>
