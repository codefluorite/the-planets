            <p className="p-center">Lo, king of planets! Giant crowned in storm,
                Thy swirling tempests never cease their rage.
                The heavens bend before thy mighty form,
                And lightning carves its wrath upon the stage.
                A hundred moons attend thee, vast and bright,
                Each one a world that waits for fateâ€™s decree.
                Yet ever turns thine own unyielding sight,
                A crimson eye that none may dare unsee.
                O ancient throne where thunders roar and break,
                What secrets in thy storm-clad heart do wake?
            </p>
