            <p className="p-center">O blessed sphere, so rich with life and song,
                The cradle where both beast and man do tread.
                Here rivers dance and whisper all day long,
                Here golden fields by sun and moon are fed.
                No jewel in all the vast celestial deep
                Can match the tender grace thou dost bestow.
                The mountains rise, the oceans wake and weep,
                And in thy heart, the seeds of wonder grow.
                O Earth, our home, our fleeting, fragile keep,
                In thee, our dreams of endless summers sleep.
            </p>
